An "Oculus Rift" game made in java, based on the jMonkey engine. 
This project is made by the group *MIGI2* for the [TU Delft] context project 2015-2016.

### About the game
The Cave of Caerbannog is a dungeon slash maze game with a simple goal: get to the treasure without
dying. At least, that is the goal for some of the players.

The players are divided into 2 teams, with 3 different roles:
One player is wearing the Oculus Rift. This player has a first or third person view of the maze and performs various actions in it. He is able to run around in the maze and pickup items like keys and bombs. Bombs will explode quickly after being picked up, so he has to think about what he want to do with it first.

There are one or two players that will work together with the Rift player, the “Helpers”. They are only able to see already explored parts of the maze, and will have a top-down, 2d view. The helpers can “see” things the Rift user cannot, and can influence the maze. For example redirecting moving platforms and distracting enemies.

The last group are the antagonists: two players who will work together to try to prevent the treasure from being stolen. The antagonists have a view similar to the helpers, but are able to see the entire maze. The antagonists have an arsenal of measures they can employ to reach their goal. For example placing fake walls, laying mines, throwing bombs and spawning killer bunnies.
