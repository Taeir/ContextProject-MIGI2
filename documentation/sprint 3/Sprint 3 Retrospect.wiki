Core functionality is implemented and has been included in this sprint’s release, but more functionality still needs to be added

I have put more hours into this task simply because I had more available. This task will be continued by Bram next sprint.

= Pull requests =

Every week, each group member also reviews pull requests of other members. Since we put a lot of time into this we also want to document time spent reviewing a separate table.

= Main Problems Encountered =

== Problem 1: Workload discrepancy  ==

'''Description:''' The workload was not evenly split over the week. We had to work a lot harder in the last part of the week. This was mainly caused by the fact that everyone needed the parts of the framework of the program to continue on their own parts. This meant lots of waiting on certain parts of the framework in the first few days of the week and weekend.

'''Reaction:''' The basic framework is now largely done, so this problem should not occur anymore. Also priorities of tasks should reflect completion time in the sprint, this means that dependencies in a sprint have a higher priority than tasks that require those dependencies.

== Problem 2: LOC importance ==

'''Description:''' The Lines Of Code per person differ too much and we as a group find that there is too much importance on the number of commits and LOC. This caused a lot of stress for certain members of the team as they put a lot of hours in the project, but they felt that the didn’t contribute much.

'''Reaction:''' During the sprint backlog meeting for sprint 4 we have tried to give code intensive tasks to members that have the fewest lines of code and we discussed the problem with the TAs during the stakeholder meeting. The TAs said that they look at a lot more details than just LOC and the number of commits as long as there is not a giant difference between the one the most LOC and commits and the persons with the least LOC and commits.

== Problem 3: Dependencies on others code ==

'''Description:''' As said earlier, everybody needed the framework to be done in order to correctly implement their features. To make matters worse, the framework relied on some other tasks too. This meant that sometimes it was very hard to correctly implement a feature or mistakes were made that had to be correct later. Each merge also was quite a challenge.

'''Reaction:''' We managed to get everything done, although it took a lot of time.

= Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan =

In the next sprint backlog we will try to make sure that tasks that are dependencies for other task have a higher priority and do those task before tasks that can be done alone or tasks that need those dependencies. This will hopefully make merging easier and prevent people having to wait on others code. This will also prevent the workload discrepancy over the week as we will be able to spread out the workload more evenly if nobody has to wait on a certain amount of code first.

The LOC and commit amount have been discussed with the TAs and we were assured that as long as there isn’t a difference of orders of magnitude in the number of commits or LOC that this is a non-issue. Though we should take care that not one person takes on all the difficult programming tasks and that we divide the work evenly.
