= Additional time spent =

Every week, we also spend additional time that is not task related. Think about lectures, meetings, presentations, etcetera.

</tr>
</table>

= Pull requests =

Every week, each group member also reviews pull requests of other members. Since we put a lot of time into this we also want to document time spent reviewing a separate table.

= Main Problems Encountered =

== Problem 1: Documentation Clarity ==

'''Description:''' The description of what had to be done for the final report wasnt clear.

'''Reaction:''' We asked our TA about what to do, and he explained it.
