Every week, each group member also reviews pull requests of other members. Since we put a lot of time into this we also want to document time spent reviewing a separate table.

= '''Main Problems Encountered''' =

== '''Problem 1''' ==

Description: GUI related testing was more difficult than expected. Travis is headless which means the tests are rather difficult to write while still having the travis build succeed.

Reaction: More time spent on testing to make sure they run headless. This meant investing a lot more time on tests than was originally accounted for.

== '''Problem 2''' ==

Description: Taico’s personal plans made it difficult to do a proper retrospect at the end of the week.

Reaction: Sprint retrospect was discussed on wednesday instead of friday, and was expanded upon by other team members.

== '''Problem 3''' ==

Description: Definition of done is too strict, which means we are obstructing ourselves.

Reaction: Multiple “done” branches couldn’t be merged into the master. All of the relevant branches will be tested next week and merged into the master.

= '''Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan''' =

Tasks will be more clearly defined.

Motivation for priorities will be given.
