Every week, each group member also reviews pull requests of other members. Since we put a lot of time into this we also want to document time spent reviewing a separate table.

= Main Problems Encountered =

== Problem 1 ==

Description: Documentation underestimation.

Cause: Unclear guidelines.

Reaction: More time spent on documentation than estimated, less time spent on code.

== Problem 2 ==

Description: Most of the work was done in the last two days.

Cause: Problem 1 and lectures were accounted for.

Reaction: Less time spent on code.

= Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan =

Take into account the lectures. This means we will try to distribute the workload more evenly across the week and among team members.
